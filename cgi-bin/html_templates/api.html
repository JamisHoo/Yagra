<p>
Yagra 'APIs' require no authentication, and are all based around simple HTTP 
GET requests. See the contents below to find out more about constructing 
request URLs, different implementation options and more.
</p>

<p>
Learn about how to generate the URLs required to request Yagra Images.
</p>

<h2>Creating the Hash</h2>

<p>
All URLs on Yagra are based on the use of the hashed value of an email 
address. Images are accessed via the hash of an email, and 
it is considered the primary way of identifying an identity within the system. 
To ensure a consistent and accurate hash, the following steps should be taken 
to create a hash:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Trim leading and trailing whitespace from an email address</li>
<li>md5 hash the final string</li>
</ol>

<p>
As an example, let's say we start with "MyEmailAddress@example.com " (note the 
trailing space which our hypothetical user entered by mistake). If we md5 
encode that string directly, we get the following (in Python 2):
</p>

<pre><code>
>>> hashlib.md5("MyEmailAddress@example.com ").hexdigest()
'f9879d71855b5ff21e4963273a886bfc'
</code></pre>

<p>
If we now run that same email address through the above process, you will see 
that we get a different result (again in Python 2):
</p>

<pre><code>
>>> hashlib.md5("MyEmailAddress@example.com".strip()).hexdigest()
'a957567ba0ce0106c0d1cfa646acdb71'
</code></pre>

<p>
Once you have generated a consistent hash, you can then request an image.
</p>

<h2>Yagra Image Requests</h2>

<h3>Base Request</h3>

<p>
Yagra images may be requested just like a normal image, using an IMG tag. 
To get an image specific to a user, you must first calculate their email hash.
</p>

<p>
The most basic image request URL looks like this:
</p>

<code>
{0[my_entire_url]}HASH
</code>

<p>
where HASH is replaced with the calculated hash for the specific email address 
you are requesting.  For example, here is my base URL:
</p>

<code>
{0[my_entire_url]}F04D5E66FF52BC9589E0B08368E8E731
</code>

<p>
When wrapped in an IMG tag, that URL will produce:
</p>

<xmp>
<img src="{0[my_entire_url]}F04D5E66FF52BC9589E0B08368E8E731" />
</xmp>

<p>
<img src="{0[my_entire_url]}F04D5E66FF52BC9589E0B08368E8E731" />
</p>

<h3>Size</h3>

<p>
You can only request the image in its original size.
</p>

<h3>Default Image</h3>

<p>
What happens when an email address has no matching Yagra image? By default, 
this:
<p>

<p><img src="{0[my_entire_url]}00000000000000000000000000000000" /> </p>

<p>
If you'd prefer to use your own default image (perhaps your logo, a funny face,
whatever), then you can easily do so by supplying the URL to an image in the 
d= or default= parameter. The URL should be URL-encoded to ensure that it 
carries across correctly, for example:
</p>

<xmp>
<img src="{0[my_entire_url]}00000000000000000000000000000000?d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F0" />
</xmp>

<p>
To URL-encode a string in Python, you can use something like this:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
>>> urllib.quote_plus("http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0")
'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F0'
</code>
</pre>

<p>
When you include a default image, Yagra will automatically redirect to that 
image if there is no image associated with the requested email hash. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to allowing you to use your own image, Yagra has a number of 
built in options which you can also use as defaults. To use these options, 
just pass one of the following keywords as the d= parameter to an image 
request:
</p>

<ul>
<li>404: do not load any image if none is associated with the email hash, 
instead return an HTTP 404 (File Not Found) response</li>
<li>blank: a transparent PNG image </li>
</ul>

<h3>Force Default</h3>

<p>
If for some reason you wanted to force the default image to always load, 
you can do that by using the f= or forcedefault= parameter, and setting its 
value to y.
</p>

<code>
{0[my_entire_url]}F04D5E66FF52BC9589E0B08368E8E731?f=y
</code>

<h3>Rating</h3>

<p>
Yagra allows users to self-rate their images so that they can indicate if an 
image is appropriate for a certain audience. By default, only 'G' rated images 
are displayed unless you indicate that you would like to see higher ratings. 
Using the r= or rating= parameters, you may specify one of the following 
ratings to request images up to and including that rating:
</p>

<ul>
<li>g: suitable for display on all websites with any audience type.</li>
<li>pg: may contain rude gestures, provocatively dressed individuals, 
the lesser swear words, or mild violence.</li>
<li>r: may contain such things as harsh profanity, intense violence, nudity, 
or hard drug use.</li>
<li>x: may contain hardcore sexual imagery or extremely disturbing violence.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the requested email hash does not have an image meeting the requested 
rating level, then the default image is returned (or the specified default, 
as per above)
</p>

<p>
To allow images rated G or PG use something like this:
</p>

<code>
{0[my_entire_url]}F04D5E66FF52BC9589E0B08368E8E731?r=pg
</code>

<h3>Combining Parameters</h3>

<p>
You may combine any and all of the above parameters to produce more 
complex/refined requests. For example, this URL will request an avatar rated 
G or PG, defaulting to a 404 response (no image) if there is not one 
associated with the requested email hash:
</p>

<code>
{0[my_entire_url]}F04D5E66FF52BC9589E0B08368E8E731?r=pg&d=404
</code>
